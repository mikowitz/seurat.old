defmodule Seurat do
  @moduledoc """
  Seurat provides a pure Elixir library for color management and conversion.

  Named for Georges Seurat, whose pointillist style provides an early analogue
  for pixel-based digital imagery, this library provides the ability to create
  colors in a number of colorspaces, modify those colors, and convert them
  between colorspaces.

  The following colorspaces are supported, each of which is described in more
  detail in its own module:

  * [RGB](`Seurat.Rgb`)
